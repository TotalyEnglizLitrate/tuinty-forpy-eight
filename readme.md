## Why?
I made this over the course of a week to test out the features of textual, and felt like sharing it.

## Installation

1. Install the script and associated files:

```
    pip install tuinty-forpy-eight
```

2. Launch the game by running `2048` in a terminal of your choice

3. Infinite fun, at your terminal!

## Customizing Colour Scheme

### 1. Background
Supply the rgb values of the background colour you want along with the 2048 command  
e.g `2048 -bg[--background] 0 0 0`  
it is optional and defaults to (143, 0, 255)  

### 2. Background Opacity
Supply the opacity as a float between 0 and 1  
e.g. `2048 -op[--opacity] 0.2`  
it is optional and defaults to 0.13  

### 3. Tile colour
Supply the rgb values of the tile colour you want along with the 2048 command  
e.g. `2048 -bg[--background] 0 0 0`  
it is optional and defaults to (237, 115, 255)

#### The above arguments can be used in combination
