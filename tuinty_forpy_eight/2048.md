## Gameplay

1. **Grid**: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.

2. **Tiles**: tiles of 2 start on the grid.

3. **Movement**: Tiles can be moved in four directions: up, down, left, and right. All tiles move as far as possible in the chosen direction until they reach the edge of the grid or collide with another tile.

4. **Combining Tiles**: When two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they merge into a single tile with a value equal to the sum of their values. For example, if two tiles with the number 2 collide, they merge to form a tile with the number 4.

5. **Scoring**: The score is determined by the value of the merged tiles. For each merge, the score is increased by the value of the new tile.

6. **Winning**: The player wins when a tile with the number 2048 is created.

7. **Losing**: The game ends when the grid is full, and no more moves can be made.
